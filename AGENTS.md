# Quality Playbook — Agent Guide

This file helps AI coding agents work on this repository. Read it first.

## What this repo is

The Quality Playbook is a skill for AI coding agents that explores any codebase from scratch and finds real bugs. It generates nine quality artifacts including a consolidated bug report with regression test patches, fix patches, and TDD red/green verification. It works with any language (Python, Java, Go, Rust, TypeScript, C, etc.) and any AI coding agent (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor). v1.5.3 adds a skill-as-code surface (project-type classifier; four-pass generate-then-verify pipeline; skill-divergence taxonomy with internal-prose / prose-to-code / execution categories; skill-project gate enforcement) so the same divergence model that finds defects in code can find defects in AI skills — see `previous_runs/v1.5.3/` for the bootstrap evidence.

## Key files

| File | Purpose | When to read |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `SKILL.md` | Full operational instructions for running the playbook | When executing the playbook on a target repo |
| `references/iteration.md` | Iteration strategy reference (gap, unfiltered, parity, adversarial) | When running iteration mode |
| `.github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py` | Mechanical validation script | After playbook completes, to validate artifacts |
| `references/*.md` | Phase-specific reference files (review protocols, spec audit, etc.) | During specific phases as directed by SKILL.md |
| `bin/skill_derivation/` | Phase 3 four-pass derivation pipeline + Phase 4 divergence detection (Skill / Hybrid projects only) | When working on the v1.5.3 skill-as-code surface |
| `bin/skill_derivation/runners.py` | LLM runner abstraction — three concrete runners: `ClaudeRunner` (`claude --print`), `CopilotRunner` (`gh copilot --prompt`), `CodexRunner` (`codex exec --full-auto`, codex-cli 0.125+) | When adding a new LLM backend or tuning subprocess invocation |
| `ai_context/TOOLKIT.md` | User-facing interactive documentation | When helping a user set up or run the playbook |
| `ai_context/DEVELOPMENT_CONTEXT.md` | Maintainer context (architecture, benchmarking, known issues) | When working on the skill itself |
| `agents/quality-playbook.agent.md` | Orchestrator agent (Copilot / general format) | When setting up automated phase-by-phase execution |
| `agents/quality-playbook-claude.agent.md` | Orchestrator agent (Claude Code format, uses sub-agents) | When running in Claude Code with automatic orchestration |

## Installing the skill

Use the canonical installer from this checkout:

```bash
./install-quality-playbook.sh /path/to/target-project
```

Default `--layout auto` updates detected existing layouts and installs the
Claude layout for a fresh target. Use `--layout all` to install Claude, Copilot
flat, and Copilot nested layouts; use `--dry-run` to preview changes. The
installer preserves `quality/`, root `AGENTS.md`, existing `reference_docs/`
contents, and `.gitignore`, and backs up locally modified installed files under
`.quality-playbook-backups/`.

`install-claude-code.sh` remains as a compatibility wrapper for Claude-only
installs:

```bash
./install-claude-code.sh /path/to/target-project
```

Manual copy commands are fallback-only when the installer cannot be run:

**GitHub Copilot fallback:**
```bash
mkdir -p .github/skills/references
cp SKILL.md .github/skills/SKILL.md
cp references/* .github/skills/references/
cp .github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py .github/skills/quality_gate.py
# v1.5.2+: single reference_docs/ tree at the target repo root.
mkdir -p reference_docs reference_docs/cite
# Optional: append suggested .gitignore rules for adopters.
cat skill-template.gitignore >> .gitignore
```

**Claude Code fallback:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/quality-playbook/references
cp SKILL.md .claude/skills/quality-playbook/SKILL.md
cp references/* .claude/skills/quality-playbook/references/
cp .github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py .claude/skills/quality-playbook/quality_gate.py
# v1.5.2+: single reference_docs/ tree at the target repo root.
mkdir -p reference_docs reference_docs/cite
cat skill-template.gitignore >> .gitignore
```

Then tell your AI tool:
```
Run the quality playbook on this project.
```

## Conventions

- **Don't edit skill files without backups.** Copy to `.bak` before modifying SKILL.md or any reference file.
- **Bump the version** in SKILL.md metadata for every change. Generated artifacts stamp this version.
- **Test changes** on at least 2 benchmark repos before committing.
- **Update ai_context/ files** if your change affects users or maintainers.
