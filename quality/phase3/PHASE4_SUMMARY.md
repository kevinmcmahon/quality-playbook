## 2. Final test counts (post-Phase-4)

| Suite | Pre-Phase-4 | Post-Phase-4 | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `bin/tests/` | 602 | **631** | +29 |
| `.github/skills/quality_gate/tests/test_quality_gate.py` | 198 | **215** | +17 |
| `.github/skills/quality_gate/tests/test_req_pattern.py` | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| **Total** | 806 | **852** | **+46** |

All 852 tests green at Phase 4 HEAD.

## 3. QPB self-audit results

### Internal-prose divergences — 29 total

| Subtype | Count |
|---|---:|
| `intra-section` | 15 |
| `cross-section-countable` | 14 |
| `un-anchored-uc` | 0 |

The 0 un-anchored-uc count is informational: UC-PHASE3-17 (Bootstrap
self-audit, the only `_metadata.phase_3d_synthesized=true` record)
*does* have section-anchor support — the Phase 0 section discusses
self-audit / continuation-mode scenarios that share enough vocabulary
with the UC's `steps`/`acceptance` to clear the 2-token-overlap
threshold.

### Prose-to-code divergences — 5 total

All 5 are `mechanical-countable` divergences from Part A.2. Sample:

```
DIV-P2C-001: claimed=50 actual=631 artifact=bin/tests/
  pattern='^\\s*def test_' disposition=spec-fix
```

Five SKILL.md sections claim "at least 50 tests" but the actual
test corpus has 631 `def test_*` methods. Provisional disposition:
`spec-fix` (prose under-counts by ~12×; the spec figure is stale).
Council should review whether to update SKILL.md's "50" to the
current count or accept the conservative floor as deliberate.

`llm-judged` (Part A.3): **0 divergences emitted on this run.**
A.3 was deferred to a separate Phase 4 follow-up to keep session
wall-clock bounded; the module + tests are landed and ready, and
the Phase 4 acceptance gate accepts a documented-empty A.3 output
on QPB.

### Execution divergences — 0 total

Expected per DQ-4-3. 1369 of 1369 QPB REQs were skipped because
none carry the `gate_check_ids` field. QPB has no `previous_runs/`
directory at the repo root either. Both gaps are documented; Phase
5's broader benchmark-target runs may surface real execution
divergences against repos like `repos/cobra-1.3.46/previous_runs/`.

### Triage outcomes

| Resolution | Count | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Fixed in source | 1 | A.2 regex `^def test_` → `^\\s*def test_` (Part G discovery: original regex missed all indented test methods inside `unittest.TestCase` subclasses; without the fix, all 5 prose-to-code divergences reported `actual=0` instead of `actual=631`). Fix landed in commit 17/17 alongside this summary. |
| Deferred with BUG record | 33 | 29 internal-prose + 5 prose-to-code-after-regex-fix. All carry `disposition=spec-fix` or null; Council triage scheduled in Phase 5. |
| False positive with fixture added | 0 | None of the 34 divergences appear false on inspection. |

## 4. Council inbox state

| Inbox | Items | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Phase 3 (`pass_d_council_inbox.json`) | 379 | unchanged from Phase 3d shape; only `triage_batch_key` field was backfilled. |
| Phase 4 (`pass_e_council_inbox.json`) | 34 | one item per BUG (29 + 5 + 0) with bug_id back-pointers. |
| **Combined Council load** | **413** | section-batched per `triage_batch_key` for Phase 5 triage. |

**`triage_batch_key` backfill verification:** post-backfill grep for
literal `"None"` in any `triage_batch_key` value → **0 hits** across
both inbox files. All 379 Phase 3 items + all 34 Phase 4 items have
populated keys of the form `<source_document>::<section_idx>` (or
`SKILL.md::unknown` for items missing both).

## 5. DQ outcomes

| DQ | Decision | Implementation status |
|---|---|---|
| DQ-4-1 (Council override workflow) | Re-run with `--override` + `--override-rationale` | Argparse landed (commit 12/17). Workflow doc at `docs/design/QPB_v1.5.3_Phase4_Council_Override_Workflow.md`. 3 CLI tests pin behavior. |
| DQ-4-2 (Tier 1 mechanical, Tier 2 LLM) | Two-tier prose-to-code | A.2 mechanical (commit 2/17, regex fix in 17/17); A.3 LLM-driven (commit 3/17, deferred run on QPB). |
| DQ-4-3 (Execution-divergence scope) | Consume archived runs only; QPB output empty by design | Implemented (commits 5-7); QPB run produced 0 divergences with 1369/1369 REQs skipped. Documented above. |
| DQ-4-4 (Skill-project gate enforcement) | 4 new check_* functions | Landed (commit 8/17); 17 tests (commit 9/17). |
| DQ-4-5 (Disposition-table degeneracy → triage_batch_key) | Section-batching field on every inbox item | 413 items batched; 0 `"None"` strings. Carry-forward to v1.5.4/v1.6.0 disposition-tree redesign explicitly noted. |
| DQ-4-6 (UC-PHASE3-17 anchor verification) | A.1 special-case path | Implemented; UC-PHASE3-17 cleared anchor verification on the live run (Phase 0 section vocabulary supports the UC). |
| DQ-4-7 (O(N²) indexing) | 3-stage partition + cross-section countable token index | Implemented; live-run wall-clock 0.24s. Comparison count exceeds the brief's 5,000 budget — see "Performance" below. |

## 6. Performance

| Metric | Brief budget | Live result on QPB | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Part A.1 wall-clock (1369 REQs) | < 5 minutes | **0.24 s** | ✓ well under |
| Part A.1 Stage 1 partitions | (informational) | 202 | — |
| Part A.1 Stage 2 pairs | combined < 5,000 | **15,636** | ⚠ over |
| Part A.1 Stage 3 pairs | (combined budget above) | **290** | — |
| **Stage 2 + Stage 3 total** | < 5,000 | **15,926** | ⚠ ~3× over |

**Calibration finding (non-blocking):** the brief's 5,000 budget
assumed REQs distribute evenly (~7 per partition; C(7,2)=21 → 21 ×
202 = 4,242). QPB's high-recall Pass A produces 6.8 REQs/partition
on average but the variance is wide: many sections cluster 15-25
REQs producing C(20,2)=190 pairs each. The live count (15,926) is
still O(N) in REQ count and far below the N²=1.87M ceiling; Phase
4 ships the instrumentation and the 0.24s wall-clock evidence as
the substantive measure. Phase 5 brief should recalibrate the
budget against this empirical floor.

**Comparison count by stage (per DQ-4-7 instrumentation):**
```json
{
  "stage1_partitions": 202,
  "stage2_pairs": 15636,
  "stage3_pairs": 290
}
```

## 7. Non-blocking observations for Phase 5 / v1.5.4

1. **A.2 regex tightening (G.1 → G.2 carry-back).** The original
   `^def test_` pattern silently miscounted indented test methods
   as 0; commit 17/17 corrects to `^\s*def test_`. Phase 5 should
   audit the other patterns (`^def check_`, `^def run_pass_`,
   `^##\s+Phase \d+`) to confirm they match the actual indentation
   conventions of their target artifacts. The current shapes do
   match, but the same shape of bug could surface again on a new
   token mapping.

2. **A.1 partition-budget recalibration.** The 5,000 budget is too
   tight for QPB's actual REQ distribution. Phase 5 brief should
   either widen to ~20,000 (reflecting empirical evidence) or
   tighten partitioning by adding a third dimension (e.g., section
   sub-block).

3. **A.3 deferred run.** The Hybrid LLM-driven path is implemented,
   tested, and resumable but was not invoked on the QPB self-audit
   to keep session wall-clock bounded. Phase 5 should either
   schedule a dedicated A.3 run on QPB (~58 candidates × ~30s/call
   × 90s pacing → ~1.5 hours) or document that A.2 mechanical
   coverage is sufficient for QPB and mark A.3 as benchmark-target
   scope.

4. **Five identical "50 tests" prose-to-code divergences.** All
   five DIV-P2C records reference different REQs but share the
   same prose claim ("at least 50 tests") because the SKILL.md
   prose repeats the figure across multiple sections. Council
   triage should resolve them as one BUG with multiple covers
   (the v1.5.0 cell-identity / `consolidation_rationale` shape
   from schemas.md §8.1 applies).

5. **Disposition-table degeneracy still affects Phase 4 inbox
   triage.** All 29 internal-prose BUGs share `disposition=null`
   or `spec-fix` — Council triage on the Phase 4 inbox needs
   section-level batching (which `triage_batch_key` provides) plus
   excerpt-content differentiation. The v1.5.4 carry-forward
   (extend Pass A's behavioral-claim categories) remains the
   structural fix.

6. **UC-PHASE3-17 anchor cleared but only just.** The 2-token
   overlap threshold in `_uc_anchor_supports()` is conservative;
   UC-17 cleared with several token matches in the Phase 0 section.
   If a future hand-authored UC has marginal anchor support, the
   threshold may need adjustment. Phase 5's broader benchmark may
   surface additional un-anchored-uc cases.

## What ships

The 17 Phase 4 commits + this summary land on the `1.5.3` branch
ready for Round 8 review:

- `bin/skill_derivation/`: 4 new modules (`divergence_internal.py`,
  `divergence_prose_to_code_mechanical.py`,
  `divergence_prose_to_code_llm.py`, `divergence_execution.py`,
  `execution_gate_loader.py`, `divergence_to_bugs.py`,
  `phase4_inbox.py`).
- `.github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py`: 4 new check_*
  functions wired into `check_v1_5_0_gate_invariants`.
- `bin/classify_project.py`: `--override` / `--override-rationale`
  argparse flags + module-docstring update.
- `docs/design/QPB_v1.5.3_Phase4_Council_Override_Workflow.md`
  (new).
- 6 new test files / classes in `bin/tests/` and gate suite.
- Live-run artifact set under `quality/phase3/`:
  `pass_e_internal_divergences.jsonl` (29),
  `pass_e_prose_to_code_divergences.jsonl` (5),
  `pass_e_execution_divergences.jsonl` (0),
  `pass_e_bugs.jsonl` (34), `pass_e_council_inbox.json` (34).
- `pass_d_council_inbox.json` backfill: 379 items now carry
  `triage_batch_key`.

Phase 5 (release-readiness) is the explicit next step. Round 8
Council reviews this Phase 4 surface; Phase 5 brief authoring
proceeds after Round 8 returns a Pass verdict.
