## Iteration history

| Iteration | Strategy | Date | Net-new bugs | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | baseline | 2026-04-18 | 16 | Runner, library, quality-gate, and spec-contract surfaces |
| 2 | gap | 2026-04-19 | 3 | Bootstrap/orchestrator/shim coverage gaps → BUG-017..BUG-019 |
| 3 | unfiltered | 2026-04-19 | 4 | Docs-warning gating, prompt portability, child-exit propagation, fixture-poisoned language detection |
| 4 | parity | 2026-04-19 | 2 | Functional-test filename-matrix drift across helper, gate existence, and extension validation → BUG-024..BUG-025 |
| 5 | adversarial | 2026-04-19 | 2 | Helper-library artifact discovery over-accepts undocumented functional/regression aliases → BUG-026..BUG-027 |

## Scale assessment

- Source files in audit scope: 8 primary code/test files plus shipped agent prompts and generated quality artifacts.
- Spec files: `SKILL.md` (canonical), `references/*.md`, `README.md`, and shipped agent prompts.
- Gathered documentation: 83 files in `docs_gathered/`, navigated via `INDEX.md`.
- Major subsystems: (1) runner orchestrator, (2) shared library, (3) quality gate validator, (4) skill specification + references, (5) shipped prompt / shim bootstrap surfaces.
- Classification per SKILL.md scale rules: small project (<50 source files). Full-coverage scope; no scope declaration required.

## Terminal Gate Verification

> "BUG tracker has 27 entries. 27 have regression tests, 0 have exemptions, 0 are unresolved. Code review confirmed 26 bugs. Spec audit confirmed 12 code bugs (1 net-new). Expected total: 26 + 1 = 27."

**Counts match. Gate passes.**

- All 27 tracker entries map to regression tests in `quality/test_regression.py`.
- Zero entries have exemptions.
- Zero entries are unresolved.
- `With docs` metadata remains correct: `docs_gathered/` exists with 83 substantive documents.
- Phase 3 artifacts present: five code-review reports.
- Phase 4 artifacts present: baseline, gap, unfiltered, parity, and adversarial auditor + triage files.
- Latest `quality_gate.py` rerun still reports **1 FAIL, 0 WARN** because BUG-023 remains open and the gate still scans `repos/` fixtures when classifying language.

## Phase 6 Mechanical Closure

[Step 6.1] Mechanical verification: PASS (exit 0)  
`bash quality/mechanical/verify.sh` receipts retained at `quality/results/mechanical-verify.log` and `.exit`.

Run complete. 27 BUGs found (26 from code review, 1 net-new from spec audit). 27 regression tests written. 0 exemptions granted.

## Exploration summary

**Core architecture:** runner (`bin/run_playbook.py`), shared library (`bin/benchmark_lib.py`), gate (`.github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py`), primary spec (`SKILL.md` + references), and shipped bootstrap surfaces (`agents/*.md`, `pytest/__main__.py`).

**New parity/adversarial findings:** the gate's functional-test filename contract drifts across helper discovery, file existence, and extension validation, and the helper library itself over-accepts undocumented functional / regression aliases, so both validator and summary paths can disagree with the published artifact contract.
