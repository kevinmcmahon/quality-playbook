# quality/

Everything the Quality Playbook writes lives under this directory. v1.5.0
consolidates the layout: `control_prompts/` and the prior-run archive
(`runs/`) are both subtrees of `quality/`, not repo-root siblings.

## Per-run `INDEX.md`

Written at end of every run (success or explicit archive) by
`bin/archive_lib.archive_run` (end-of-Phase-6 hook on a clean pass) or
`bin/migrate_v1_5_0_layout.py` (backfill for pre-v1.5.0 archives). The
required fields match schemas.md §11 and are enforced by the gate:

- `run_timestamp_start`, `run_timestamp_end`, `duration_seconds`
- `qpb_version`, `target_repo_path`, `target_repo_git_sha`,
  `target_project_type`
- `phases_executed[]` — one entry per phase that ran, with `phase_id`,
  `model`, `start`, `end`, `exit_status`
- `summary.requirements` — counts by tier (1–5, plus `"unknown"` for
  legacy REQs without a `**Tier**` marker)
- `summary.bugs` — counts by severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) and disposition
  (code-fix, spec-fix, upstream-spec-issue, mis-read, deferred)
- `summary.gate_verdict` — one of `pass` / `fail` / `partial`
- `artifacts[]` — relative paths produced by the run

The file format is markdown with a fenced `json` block carrying the
structured fields (the gate parses the JSON block, not the surrounding
prose).

## Top-level `RUN_INDEX.md`

Append-only. One row per archived run: run id, QPB version, project
type, gate verdict, bug count, and a relative link to that run's
`INDEX.md`. Prior rows are never rewritten — `archive_run` appends a
new row on each invocation and is idempotent when a row for the run id
already exists.

## `results/` and timestamped files

Files written via `bin/archive_lib.write_timestamped_result` land at
`quality/results/<basename>-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ.<ext>` alongside a
`<basename>-latest.<ext>` pointer (symlink on POSIX, copy on
non-symlink-capable filesystems). The `-latest` pointer always resolves
to the newest file so naive consumers can read it without scanning the
directory.

This pattern applies to recheck results, gate reports, and any other
artifact that can be regenerated multiple times during a run.

## Tracking `quality/runs/` in git — project choice

Archived runs can grow large (per-phase prompts + LLM outputs + patches
across many iterations). Whether to track `quality/runs/` is a
project-level decision:

- **Skill-template default** (`skill-template.gitignore` at the QPB
  repo root): `quality/runs/` is ignored with a `!quality/RUN_INDEX.md`
  exception. New adopters who `cat skill-template.gitignore >>
  .gitignore` don't accidentally commit bulk history while still
  tracking the top-level index for reviewers.
- **QPB's own repo**: `quality/runs/` IS tracked. The archived runs
  are canonical self-audit / bootstrap evidence — proof of work for the
  playbook itself. QPB's `.gitignore` deliberately omits the
  `quality/runs/` rule.

The template default errs on the side of small repos. If you track
runs, plan for repo size; if you ignore runs, the gate and orchestrator
still work — only the historical record moves out of version control.

## Pointers

- Data contract: `schemas.md` §11 (per-run `INDEX.md` fields) + §9
  (Council-of-Three `citation_semantic_check.json`) + §1.6 (manifest
  wrapper).
- Orchestrator: `bin/run_playbook.py` (phase execution, gate hook).
- Migration: `bin/migrate_v1_5_0_layout.py` (pre-v1.5.0 → v1.5.0 move).
- Archival: `bin/archive_lib.py` (`archive_run`,
  `write_timestamped_result`, CLI for operator-driven failed/partial
  archive).
- Gate: `.github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py` (§10
  mechanical invariants; Layer-1 hallucination mitigation).
