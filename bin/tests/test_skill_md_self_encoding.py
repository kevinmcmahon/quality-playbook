"""SKILL.md self-encoding prose-contract tests (v1.5.4 Phase 3.9, B-18b).

After the Phase 3.9 rewrite, SKILL.md self-encodes the canonical
invocation, bootstrap mode, v1.5.4 mechanics pointers, the
operational guardrails, and the output artifact contract — so that a
single-line operator prompt ("Run the Quality Playbook") pointed at
any AI agent against any QPB-installed target produces a v1.5.4-shape
bootstrap run without further hand-holding.

These tests are coarse string-presence assertions. They protect
against accidental regressions during future SKILL.md edits — if a
maintainer trims the prose and drops the canonical-invocation
reference, the no-delegation guardrail, etc., the matching test
fires.

The tests do NOT pin exact wording. The brief explicitly framed
these as "string-presence" assertions; they catch the load-bearing
content disappearing, not phrasing changes. If a future edit
substantively reshapes the section AND the corresponding test fails,
update the test alongside the prose — the test pins the contract,
not a literal copy.
