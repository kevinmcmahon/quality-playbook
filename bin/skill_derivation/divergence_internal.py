"""divergence_internal.py — Phase 4 Part A.1: internal-prose divergence detection.

Reads pass_c_formal.jsonl + pass_c_formal_use_cases.jsonl from
quality/phase3/ and emits pass_e_internal_divergences.jsonl listing
within-prose contradictions per the v1.5.3 Design "Category A:
Internal Divergence" model.

Three-stage indexing per DQ-4-7 of the Phase 4 brief:

  Stage 1 — Partition by (source_document, section_idx). REQ pairs
            are only compared if they share the same key. UCs and
            REQs with source_document=None partition under
            ("SKILL.md", section_idx).
  Stage 2 — Within each section's REQ list, run pairwise excerpt-
            overlap detection. Emit subtype="intra-section".
  Stage 3 — Cross-section countable-claim index. Extract token-
            countable claims (regex matching "<N> <noun>") from
            acceptance_criteria; group records by
            (source_document, normalized_token); within each token's
            REQ list, compare claimed numeric values. Mismatches
            emit subtype="cross-section-countable".

Plus the DQ-4-6 special case: for any UC with
_metadata.phase_3d_synthesized=true, run anchor verification first;
if the UC's section anchor does not loosely support its
steps/acceptance, emit subtype="un-anchored-uc" and skip pairwise
processing for that UC.

Provisional disposition rules per schemas.md §3.9:
- SKILL.md vs reference-file conflict: SKILL.md wins;
  provisional_disposition="spec-fix", target=reference file.
- Intra-SKILL.md (two SKILL.md sections conflict):
  provisional_disposition=null, target=null. Council decides.
- Reference-file vs reference-file: same as intra-SKILL.md.

The module is pure-mechanical and idempotent on inputs. To re-run,
delete pass_e_internal_divergences.jsonl and re-invoke.
