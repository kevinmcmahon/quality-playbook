"""sections.py — SKILL.md / reference-file section enumeration for Phase 3.

Pass A iterates over the section tree rather than over the file
verbatim; this module produces the deterministic enumeration that
defines the iteration unit set. Decisions are encoded here once so
all four passes agree on what counts as a "section" and what counts
as a meta section.

Rules implemented (per the Phase 3 brief "Section enumeration spec"):

  1. Fenced-block-aware. Headings inside ``` fenced blocks are
     template fragments, NOT document structure -- skipped.
  2. Top-level iteration unit is `##`. `###` and below are
     sub-sections within their parent `##`. The split rule (>300
     lines per top-level section) splits at the next heading level
     down (`###`).
  3. Duplicate-heading-tolerant. Sections are indexed by an
     auto-assigned monotonic `section_idx`; heading text is
     informational only.
  4. Meta-section allowlist (META_SECTION_ALLOWLIST). Headings on
     the allowlist are emitted with `skip_reason: "meta-allowlist"`
     and Pass A produces no draft REQs for them. Pass D treats them
     as intentional skips for completeness accounting.

Stdlib-only.
