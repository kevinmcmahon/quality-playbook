"""citation_search.py — Pass B's fuzzy text search step (Phase 3).

bin/citation_verifier.py is a byte-equality verifier; it takes a
known (section, line) locator and produces a deterministic excerpt.
It does NOT search for text. Pass B therefore needs a separate
search step that locates candidate matches in SKILL.md / reference
files, after which citation_verifier.extract_excerpt formalizes the
excerpt at the located line.

Stdlib-only: difflib.SequenceMatcher with token-boundary alignment.
The match is "best contiguous window of source lines whose
normalized text best matches the candidate text," where the score
is SequenceMatcher.ratio() and the window slides over the document
line-by-line.

Threshold (default 0.6) is configurable per call. Below threshold
the search returns None (caller treats as `unverified`); above
threshold returns the (document, line, score, line_range) tuple.
