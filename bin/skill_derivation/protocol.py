"""protocol.py — Per-Pass Execution Protocol primitives for Phase 3.

Implements the "disk is the source of truth" contract documented in
`docs/design/QPB_v1.5.3_Implementation_Plan.md` Phase 3 "Per-Pass
Execution Protocol":

  - Atomic progress-file writes (tmp + os.replace)
  - JSONL append-only artifacts
  - Cursor advances ONLY after the per-unit JSONL record is on disk
  - Recovery on resume: read progress, read last JSONL record, verify
    last_record.idx + 1 == cursor, roll cursor back on discrepancy
  - Recovery preamble template (LLM-prompt-time)

Stdlib-only. The mechanics here are correctness-critical for
long-running passes that survive auto-compaction and process kills.
