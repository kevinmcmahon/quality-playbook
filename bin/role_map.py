"""role_map.py — QPB v1.5.4 Phase 1 file-role-tagging schema and helpers.

QPB v1.5.4 Part 1 replaces the v1.5.3 mechanical Code/Skill/Hybrid project
classifier with AI-driven file-by-file role tagging produced during Phase 1
exploration. The Phase 1 LLM agent reads SKILL.md (if present) and each
file in the target tree, then emits ``quality/exploration_role_map.json``
with one record per file plus an aggregate ``breakdown``. This module is
the canonical schema definition + reader/validator that all consumers
(INDEX rendering in archive_lib, the four-pass derivation pipeline in
skill_derivation/pass_c, and the skill-side checks in quality_gate.py)
share.

See ``docs/design/QPB_v1.5.4_Design.md`` Part 1 for the rationale that
motivated the redesign and ``docs/design/QPB_v1.5.4_Implementation_Plan.md``
Phase 1 for the work-item breakdown.

Role taxonomy (the fixed surface; new roles must be added here AND in
the Phase 1 prompt's role-taxonomy section in run_playbook.phase1_prompt):

  - ``skill-prose``     SKILL.md / agents/* / declarative skill content.
  - ``skill-reference`` Additional reference docs the skill names
                        (e.g. ``references/exploration_patterns.md``).
  - ``skill-tool``      A script the skill prose explicitly references
                        AND tells the agent to invoke. Distinguished
                        from ``code`` by being subordinate to skill
                        prose; the SKILL.md is the contract, the script
                        is the implementation.
  - ``code``            Independent orchestrator/library code that
                        carries its own behavior contract (e.g. QPB's
                        ``bin/run_playbook.py``).
  - ``test``            Test files and harnesses.
  - ``docs``            README, CHANGELOG, design docs, anything in
                        ``docs/``.
  - ``config``          ``.gitignore``, ``pyproject.toml``, settings.
  - ``fixture``         Test fixtures or example data used by tests.
  - ``formal-spec``     RFCs, external specifications, citable sources.
  - ``playbook-output`` Files inside a target's ``quality/`` subtree
                        from a prior playbook run. Tagging these
                        explicitly prevents the v1.5.3 LOC-pollution
                        bug: prior-run artifacts are no longer counted
                        as the target's own surface.

The legacy-project-type derivation exists ONLY to feed the v1.5.3 6-row
disposition table inside pass_c (Branch 5 vs Branch 6 hinges on whether
a behavioral claim can be demoted to a code-derived Tier 5, which in turn
hinges on whether the project has any code surface). It is not a return
of the Code/Skill/Hybrid trichotomy as an input field; it is an internal
mapping used by exactly one consumer.

    v1.5.4 Phase 3.6.1 Section A.1.c (codex-prevention M3): codex's
    2026-04-29 self-audit attempt produced an EXPLORATION.md narrative
    that cited a sane file count (~293) while the JSON role map held
    5287 entries. The LLM hallucinated agreement between the two
    artifacts. Both the role map's top-level ``summary`` field AND
    EXPLORATION.md's "File inventory" section MUST render from this
    helper so the agreement is mechanical, not aspirational.

    Returns a dict with:
      - ``file_count`` (int) — total entries in role_map["files"]
      - ``role_breakdown`` (dict[str, int]) — per-role counts
      - ``percentages`` (dict[str, float]) — the four shares
      - ``provenance`` (str) — passed through from the role map

    The ``role_breakdown`` is taken from
    ``role_map["breakdown"]["files_by_role"]`` so the count is
    consistent with what was previously computed; ``file_count`` is
    the raw length of the files list (catches the "breakdown was
    computed but new files were appended without recomputing"
