# Quality Playbook

Point an AI coding tool at any codebase. Get a complete quality engineering infrastructure: requirements derived from the actual intent of the code, functional tests traced to those requirements, a three-pass code review protocol, and a multi-model spec audit that catches bugs no single reviewer can find alone.

**Version:** 1.4.6 | **Author:** [Andrew Stellman](https://github.com/andrewstellman) | **License:** Apache 2.0

## Find the 35% of bugs that code review misses

Most AI code review can only find structural issues: null dereferences, resource leaks, race conditions. That catches about 65% of real defects. The other 35% are intent violations -- bugs that can only be found if you know what the code is *supposed* to do. A function that silently returns null instead of throwing, a duplicate-key check that passes when the first value is null, a sanitization step that runs after the branch decision it was supposed to guard. These bugs look correct to any reviewer that doesn't know the spec.

The playbook closes that gap. It reads your codebase, derives behavioral requirements from every source it can find (code, docs, specs, comments, defensive patterns, community documentation), and uses those requirements to drive review. The result is a quality system grounded in intent, not just structure. For a deeper look at this problem, see the O'Reilly Radar article [AI Is Writing Our Code Faster Than We Can Verify It](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-is-writing-our-code-faster-than-we-can-verify-it/).

## How to use the Quality Playbook to find bugs in your code

### Step 1: Provide documentation (strongly recommended)

The playbook produces better requirements, fewer false positives, and more specific
bugs when it has written documentation to work from. Plaintext files only —
`.txt` and `.md`. Convert other formats first:

- `pdftotext spec.pdf spec.txt`
- `pandoc -t plain spec.docx -o spec.txt`
- `lynx -dump https://example.org/spec.html > spec.txt`

**Where to put documentation in your target repo:**

    reference_docs/
    ├── claude-chat-2026-03-15.md    ← AI chat logs, design notes (Tier 4 context)
    ├── design-notes.md              ← exploratory writeups, retrospectives
    ├── incident-2026-02-retro.md    ← post-mortems, lessons learned
    └── cite/
        ├── my-project-spec.md       ← your project's own spec (citable)
        └── rfc7807.txt              ← external standards you cite (citable)

**Top-level `reference_docs/`** holds Tier 4 context — chat logs, design notes,
retrospectives, any exploratory material. The playbook reads these into Phase 1
as background but does not byte-verify quotes from them.

**`reference_docs/cite/`** holds citable material — specs, RFCs, API contracts,
published standards. Every file here produces a `FORMAL_DOC` record with a
mechanical citation excerpt that `quality_gate.py` byte-verifies. If you cite
it in a BUG or REQ, the gate checks the quote matches the bytes on disk.

You do not need a sidecar file, a frontmatter header, or any metadata.
Placement in `cite/` is the flag that says "this is citable." (Optional: the
first non-blank line of a `cite/` file may carry `<!-- qpb-tier: 2 -->` or
`# qpb-tier: 2` to mark it as Tier 2. Absent marker defaults to Tier 1.)

If you have no documentation at all, the playbook still runs. It will operate
from the source tree alone (Tier 3 evidence) and produce Tier 5 inferred
requirements. The results are weaker but valid.

**What does not belong in reference_docs:**

- Binary or formatted files (PDF, DOCX, HTML) — convert first, commit plaintext
- Code excerpts — the source tree is already Tier 3 authority
- Test fixtures or sample data — these are project artifacts, not documentation
- Anything private or sensitive that should not be read by an LLM — `reference_docs/`
  contents are loaded into Phase 1 prompts

### Step 2: Install the skill

Copy the skill files into your project:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/quality-playbook/references
cp SKILL.md .claude/skills/quality-playbook/SKILL.md
cp references/* .claude/skills/quality-playbook/references/
# v1.5.2: single reference_docs/ tree at the target repo root.
# No README ships — cite/ contents are adopter-provided plaintext.
mkdir -p reference_docs reference_docs/cite
# Optional: append the suggested .gitignore rules for adopters (keeps bulk
# archived runs + reference_docs content out of version control while tracking
# the top-level RUN_INDEX.md).
cat skill-template.gitignore >> .gitignore
```

**GitHub Copilot (flat layout):**
```bash
mkdir -p .github/skills/references
cp SKILL.md .github/skills/SKILL.md
cp references/* .github/skills/references/
# v1.5.2: single reference_docs/ tree at the target repo root.
mkdir -p reference_docs reference_docs/cite
cat skill-template.gitignore >> .gitignore
```

**GitHub Copilot (nested layout):**
```bash
mkdir -p .github/skills/quality-playbook/references
cp SKILL.md .github/skills/quality-playbook/SKILL.md
cp references/* .github/skills/quality-playbook/references/
# v1.5.2: single reference_docs/ tree at the target repo root.
mkdir -p reference_docs reference_docs/cite
cat skill-template.gitignore >> .gitignore
```

**Cursor, Windsurf, other tools:** Use any of the locations above, or put `SKILL.md` and `references/` in your project root. The runner, gate, and orchestrator agents check all four locations — repo-root `SKILL.md`, Claude's `.claude/skills/quality-playbook/`, and both Copilot layouts.

### Step 3: Run the playbook

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude --agent agents/quality-playbook.agent.md
```
Add `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to skip file-write approval prompts.

**GitHub Copilot:** Open the chat panel in VS Code, IntelliJ, or any IDE with Copilot support and say: *"Run the quality playbook on this project."* For the CLI, use `copilot-cli` with `--yolo` to skip prompts.

**Cursor:** Open Composer (Cmd+I / Ctrl+I) and say: *"Read SKILL.md and run the quality playbook on this project."*

**Windsurf:** Open Cascade and say: *"Read SKILL.md and run the quality playbook on this project."*

<a href="images/claude-code-bootstrap-2.png"><img src="images/claude-code-bootstrap-0.png" alt="Giving Claude Code the initial prompt to start the playbook" width="700"></a>

The playbook runs in six phases. Each phase gets its own context window — this is what lets it do deep analysis instead of running out of context on large codebases. After each phase, say "keep going" to continue.

<a href="images/claude-code-bootstrap-2.png"><img src="images/claude-code-bootstrap-2.png" alt="Phase 1 results: 6 candidate bugs found" width="700"></a>

*After Phase 1, the playbook reports candidate bugs and tells you what to say next.*

<a href="images/claude-code-bootstrap-4.png"><img src="images/claude-code-bootstrap-4.png" alt="Phase 5: TDD verification of confirmed bugs" width="700"></a>

*Phase 5 confirms every bug with TDD red-green verification and generates fix patches.*

<a href="images/claude-code-bootstrap-5.png"><img src="images/claude-code-bootstrap-5.png" alt="Final results: 7 confirmed bugs with patches" width="700"></a>

*The final summary shows all confirmed bugs with regression tests, patches, and writeups.*

The six phases: **Explore** (read code + docs, find candidates) → **Generate** (requirements, tests, protocols) → **Code Review** (three-pass: structural, requirement verification, cross-requirement consistency) → **Spec Audit** (three independent auditors check code against requirements) → **Reconciliation** (every bug tracked, regression-tested, TDD-verified) → **Verify** (45 self-check benchmarks). The full cycle takes 15-90 minutes depending on project size and works with any language.

### Step 4: Run iterations

After the baseline, the playbook suggests iteration strategies that find different classes of bugs — typically 40-60% more on top of the baseline. Say *"Run the next iteration using the gap strategy"* to start, then follow the suggested order: gap → unfiltered → parity → adversarial.

### Running everything autonomously

To run the full baseline and all four iterations without manual intervention:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude --agent agents/quality-playbook-claude.agent.md --dangerously-skip-permissions -p \
  "Run the full quality playbook with all iterations. Run each phase as a separate
   sub-agent, then run all four iteration strategies (gap, unfiltered, parity,
   adversarial) in sequence, each as a separate sub-agent. Do not stop between
   phases or iterations — run everything end to end."
```

To capture the output to a log file, add `2>&1 | tee playbook-run.log` to the end.

This uses the orchestrator agent (`quality-playbook-claude.agent.md`), which spawns a separate sub-agent for each of the six phases and each of the four iteration strategies. Each sub-agent gets its own context window, communicates with the others through files on disk (`quality/PROGRESS.md`, `quality/BUGS.md`, etc.), and exits when its phase is complete. The orchestrator reads the results and launches the next sub-agent.

Three things in the prompt matter:

**"Run each phase as a separate sub-agent"** — this is the most important part. Each phase needs the full context window for deep analysis. If the agent tries to run multiple phases in a single context, it runs out of room partway through Phase 3 on most projects, producing shallow analysis and fewer bugs. Separate sub-agents mean each phase gets ~200K tokens of context for investigation.

**"All four iteration strategies in sequence"** — iterations re-explore the codebase with different approaches: gap (areas the baseline missed), unfiltered (pure domain-driven exploration without structural constraints), parity (compare parallel code paths), and adversarial (challenge prior dismissals). Each strategy finds a different class of bug. Running all four typically adds 40-60% more confirmed bugs on top of the baseline.

**"Do not stop between phases or iterations"** — by default, the playbook pauses after each phase and waits for the user to say "keep going." This is useful when you want to review intermediate results, but for an autonomous run you want it to continue through all ten sub-agents (six phases + four iterations) without interruption.

The full autonomous run takes 60-180 minutes depending on codebase size and model. Add `--model sonnet` or `--model opus` to choose a specific model.

### Step 5: Fix bugs, then recheck

After fixing the bugs from BUGS.md, say *"recheck"* to verify your fixes. Recheck mode reads the existing bug report, checks each bug against the current source (reverse-applying patches, inspecting cited lines), and reports which bugs are fixed vs. still open. Takes 2-10 minutes instead of re-running the full pipeline.

## Running the playbook: phases, iterations, and macros

`bin/run_playbook.py` exposes three invocation modes:

**Mode 1 — Single baseline run (default):**

    python3 bin/run_playbook.py ./my-project

Runs Phase 1 through Phase 6 in sequence on one target.

**Mode 2 — Explicit iteration list:**

    python3 bin/run_playbook.py --iterations gap,unfiltered,parity,adversarial ./my-project

Runs baseline + the listed iteration strategies in order. **Early-stop is disabled** when `--iterations` is explicit — every strategy in the list runs regardless of prior yields.

**Mode 3 — `--full-run` macro:**

    python3 bin/run_playbook.py --full-run ./my-project

Equivalent to baseline + all four iteration strategies (`gap`, `unfiltered`, `parity`, `adversarial`) in order, **with early-stop enabled.** If yields drop below the threshold, remaining iterations are skipped.

Use Mode 2 when you want to force all four strategies to run even if early-stop would trigger. Use Mode 3 for unattended runs where you're happy to save budget on clearly-exhausted cycles.

## Rate limits and run budgets

- **GitHub Copilot GPT-5.4:** Copilot enforces a 54-hour cooldown on ~15M-token prompts. Plan benchmark re-runs accordingly — the casbin-1.5.1 incident locked out GPT-5.4 for two days mid-release.
- **Claude Code plan budget:** a full run of the playbook on a 50K-LOC project typically consumes ~30% of a Sonnet-family monthly budget. Budget surges during Phase 4 (Spec Audit, three parallel auditors) and Phase 5 (TDD red-green verification on many bugs).
- **Reference-doc scaling:** the playbook reads all of `reference_docs/` into Phase 1 context. Keep it under ~2M tokens to avoid context-budget pressure on downstream phases. For very large specs, curate the excerpts that are actually cited rather than dumping full RFCs.

### Why phases?

The playbook runs each phase in a separate context window on purpose. A single-session approach runs out of context partway through Phase 3 on most projects, which means shallow analysis and missed bugs. The phase-by-phase design gives each phase the full context budget for deep investigation. The tradeoff is saying "keep going" a few times — or use the autonomous mode above to skip the manual steps entirely.

## Need help? Just ask your AI

You don't need to read the documentation to use the Quality Playbook — your AI coding tool can read it for you. The [`ai_context/TOOLKIT.md`](https://github.com/andrewstellman/quality-playbook/blob/main/ai_context/TOOLKIT.md) file explains everything about the playbook in a format designed for AI assistants to read and answer questions about.

Open a chat in any AI tool — Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, whatever you use — attach [`ai_context/TOOLKIT.md`](https://github.com/andrewstellman/quality-playbook/blob/main/ai_context/TOOLKIT.md) and tell it:

> "Read TOOLKIT.md. Now you're an expert in the Quality Playbook."

<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/69dee323-1f34-832f-aa98-06e606aff1d0"><img src="images/chatgpt-toolkit.png" alt="ChatGPT with TOOLKIT.md attached" width="1000"></a>

Then ask it anything you want. How do I set this up? What does Phase 3 actually do? How does it find bugs that structural code review misses? What's the difference between gap and adversarial iteration? Why did my run only find one bug? Ask as many questions as you want — the toolkit has detailed explanations of every technique, every phase, and every iteration strategy. Your AI assistant will walk you through setup, running, interpreting results, and improving your next run.

[Here's what that conversation looks like in ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/69dee323-1f34-832f-aa98-06e606aff1d0) — it works just as well in Claude, Copilot, Gemini, or any other AI coding tool.

## What the playbook produces

The playbook generates these files:

| Artifact | Location | What it does |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `REQUIREMENTS.md` | `quality/` | Behavioral requirements derived from code, docs, and community sources via a five-phase pipeline. This is the foundation -- without requirements, review is limited to structural bugs. |
| `QUALITY.md` | `quality/` | Quality constitution defining what "correct" means for this specific project, with fitness-to-purpose scenarios and coverage theater prevention. |
| `test_functional.*` | `quality/` | Functional tests in the project's native language, traced to requirements rather than generated from source code. |
| `RUN_CODE_REVIEW.md` | `quality/` | Three-pass protocol: structural review, requirement verification, cross-requirement consistency. Each pass finds bugs the others can't. |
| `RUN_SPEC_AUDIT.md` | `quality/` | Council of Three: three independent AI models audit the code against requirements. Different models have different blind spots, and the triage uses confidence weighting, not majority vote. |
| `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` | `quality/` | End-to-end test protocol grounded in use cases, with a traceability column mapping each test to the user outcome it validates. |
| `RUN_TDD_TESTS.md` | `quality/` | Red-green TDD verification protocol: for each confirmed bug, prove the regression test fails on unpatched code and passes with the fix. |
| `BUGS.md` | `quality/` | Consolidated bug report with spec basis, severity, reproduction steps, and patch references for every confirmed finding. |
| `AGENTS.md` | project root | Bootstrap file so every future AI session inherits the full quality infrastructure. |

## How it works

The playbook's value comes from requirement derivation. AI code reviewers are bottlenecked by the same thing human reviewers are: if you don't know what the code is *supposed* to do, you can only find structural issues. The playbook's main job is figuring out intent, then using that intent to drive every downstream artifact.

**Phase 1: Explore.** The AI reads source files, tests, config, specs, and commit history. If you provide community documentation (GitHub issues, user guides, API docs, forum discussions), it reads those too. The goal is to understand not just what the code does, but what it's supposed to do.

**Phase 2: Generate.** A five-phase pipeline extracts behavioral contracts from the codebase, derives testable requirements, verifies coverage, checks completeness, and adds a narrative layer with validated use cases. The pipeline also generates functional tests, review protocols, a TDD verification protocol, and the quality constitution.

**Phase 3: Code review.** A three-pass code review runs against HEAD: structural review with anti-hallucination guardrails, requirement verification checking each requirement against the code, and cross-requirement consistency checking whether requirements contradict each other. About 65% of findings come from Pass 1, 35% from Passes 2 and 3. Each confirmed bug gets a regression test.

**Phase 4: Spec audit.** Three independent AI models audit the code against the requirements. The triage process uses verification probes -- targeted checks that ask "is this actually true?" -- rather than dismissing single-model findings. As of v1.3.17, verification probes must produce executable test assertions (not just prose reasoning) to confirm or reject findings, which prevents the triage from hallucinating code compliance. The most valuable findings are often the ones only one model catches.

**Phase 5: Reconciliation.** Post-review reconciliation closes the loop: every bug from code review and spec audit is tracked, regression-tested or explicitly exempted, and the completeness report is finalized with one authoritative verdict.

**Phase 6: Verify.** 45 self-check benchmarks validate the generated artifacts against internal consistency rules -- requirement counts match across all surfaces, no stale text remains, every finding has a closure status, and triage probes include executable evidence.

### Why documentation matters

Adding community documentation to the pipeline produces measurably better results. In a controlled experiment across multiple repositories, documentation-enriched runs found more bugs, different bugs, and higher-confidence bugs than code-only baselines. The documentation gives auditors spec language to check against, turning "this code looks odd" into "this code contradicts the documented behavior."

### What's new in v1.5.1

- **Phase 5 writeup hardening.** `bin/run_playbook.py::phase5_prompt()` now carries a MANDATORY HYDRATION STEP with a BUGS.md → writeup field map, a worked BUG-004 example, and a per-writeup confirmation checklist that prohibits empty backticks, empty diff fences, and angle-bracket placeholders. This closes the Phase 5 failure mode observed on `bus-tracker-1.5.0`, where the playbook produced skeletal writeups that passed the legacy gate despite having no file paths, no line ranges, no inline diffs, and no regression-test references.
- **Quality-gate writeup hydration checks.** `check_writeups` in `.github/skills/quality_gate/quality_gate.py` now fails when any writeup contains one of five template-sentinel strings (the stub language from `phase5_prompt()`'s pre-hydration template) or when a ` ```diff ` fence is present but contains no `+` / `-` lines other than file headers. Stub writeups can no longer slip past the gate by leaving template scaffolding intact.
- **Case-insensitive diff fence detection.** The hydration gate recognises ` ```diff `, ` ```Diff `, and ` ```DIFF ` uniformly via `_WRITEUP_DIFF_BLOCK_RE`, so inline-diff presence and content checks can't disagree on whether a fence exists. Previously a writeup with a mixed-case fence would trip a confusing "no inline fix diffs" FAIL despite containing a visible unified diff.
- **Quality-gate tests.** New unit-test coverage for sentinel detection and empty-diff-fence detection lands alongside the gate changes, extending the existing quality-gate test suite.

### What's new in v1.4.6

- **27 bugs fixed from the v1.4.5 bootstrap self-audit.** The Opus self-audit over v1.4.5 baseline + four iteration strategies (gap, unfiltered, parity, adversarial) confirmed 27 real defects spanning version parsers, phase entry gates, archive atomicity, runner reliability, quality-gate validation, prompt portability, and orchestrator bootstrap. All 27 shipped as fixes with passing regression tests; recheck reports 27/27 FIXED. Shipped in seven thematic commits. Highlights: the Phase 2 gate now FAILs below 120 lines instead of WARNing at 80 (matching SKILL.md §Phase 1 completion gate); the Phase 3 gate checks all nine Phase 2 artifacts instead of four; the Phase 5 gate enforces SKILL.md's hard-stop (`*triage*` + `*auditor*` files + Phase 4 `[x]`); `archive_previous_run` stages into a `.partial` subfolder under the runs archive and then atomically renames, preserving `control_prompts/` content instead of deleting it; `cleanup_repo` adds `AGENTS.md` to the protected-path set; child-process exit codes propagate through `run_one_phase` / `run_one_singlepass`; missing `docs_gathered/` WARNs and continues with code-only analysis instead of blocking; runner prompts now advertise all four documented install paths via a new `SKILL_FALLBACK_GUIDE` constant; `check_run_metadata` and `_check_exploration_sections` plug two long-standing gate gaps; `validate_iso_date` accepts ISO 8601 datetimes; `_parse_porcelain_path` unwraps Git's quoted paths; `detect_project_language` skips nested benchmark fixture repos. Full per-bug detail in `quality/results/recheck-summary.md`.
- **Bootstrap artifacts tracked in git.** The `quality/` tree — including archived prior runs under `quality/runs/` and per-phase prompt output under `quality/control_prompts/` — is in version control as project history. Earlier it was untracked to avoid `cleanup_repo`'s `git checkout .` wiping it; now `cleanup_repo` protects `quality/` explicitly, so the tree can be tracked without risk. Future iterations can diff against it. (Pre-v1.5.1 releases used root-level `previous_runs/` and `control_prompts/` directories; v1.5.1's `bin/migrate_v1_5_0_layout.py` moves those into `quality/` as part of the consolidated layout.)

### What's new in v1.4.5

- **Python runner with a path-based interface.** `bin/run_playbook.py` treats every positional argument as a directory path (relative or absolute) and defaults to the current directory when none are given. No more short-name resolution, no hardcoded `repos/` lookups — the runner works against any project you point it at. A narrow version-append fallback kicks in only for bare names (no path separators): if `chi` isn't a directory, the runner retries `chi-<skill_version>` once, using the `version:` line from `SKILL.md`. Log files live next to each target (`{parent}/{target-name}-playbook-{timestamp}.log`). Missing SKILL.md is a warning, not a fatal error, so first-time installs aren't blocked. 36 stdlib-only unit tests at release (grew to 92 with v1.4.6 regression coverage).
- **Python gate is the sole mechanical gate.** `quality_gate.sh` has been retired. `quality_gate.py` now handles JSON with `json.load` instead of grep-style parsing and lives at `.github/skills/quality_gate/` as a proper package with a 108-test unit-test suite. A stable symlink at `.github/skills/quality_gate.py` preserves the previous invocation path.
- **Benchmark set reduced to four targets** — bootstrap, chi, cobra, virtio — so full validation loops finish in a reasonable window. Bootstrap always runs last because fixes from the other three need to land before the playbook audits itself.
- **Rate limit warning added.** The README and runner docs now call out that running many targets in parallel with single-prompt mode can trigger multi-day Copilot cooldowns; `--phase all` with `--sequential` is the recommended mode.

### What's new in v1.4.4

- **Orchestrator hardening — "you are the orchestrator" architecture.** Motivated by failures on the casbin run, the orchestrator agents now explicitly forbid three failure modes: single-context collapse (running all six phases in one context window), `claude -p` subprocess spawning (forking new CLI sessions instead of using the Agent tool), and nested Agent-tool stripping (sub-agents trying to spawn their own sub-agents, which Claude Code silently strips). The session reading the agent file IS the orchestrator — it spawns one sub-agent per phase and nothing else.
- **Shared orchestrator protocol.** The hardening rules now live in `references/orchestrator_protocol.md` and are imported by both `agents/quality-playbook-claude.agent.md` and `agents/quality-playbook.agent.md`. Critical rules are also duplicated inline in each agent file so a partial read still enforces them.

### What's new in v1.4.3

- **Challenge gate for false-positive detection.** Before closure, the triage must re-review CRITICAL findings against common-sense reality checks. Motivated by edgequake benchmarking, where six "CRITICAL" tenant-isolation bugs turned out to be documented feature gaps and a seventh was a self-documenting `change-me-in-production` development placeholder. The gate forces that common-sense review to happen before findings are finalized.
- **Functional-test reference reorganized.** Per-language functional-test guidance was split into separate reference files, then re-merged back into a single `references/functional_tests.md` with the import patterns folded in. Easier to maintain, easier for agents to read.

### What's new in v1.4.2

- **25 bug fixes from Sonnet 4.6 bootstrap self-audit.** Fixed nullglob-vulnerable artifact detection across 7 locations (ls-glob replaced with find), severity-prefixed bug ID support (BUG-H1/BUG-M3/BUG-L6), TDD sidecar-to-log cross-validation, recheck-results.json gate validation, Phase 5 entry gate, and integration enum validation. All verified by recheck (25/25 FIXED).
- **Run metadata for multi-model comparison.** Every playbook run creates a timestamped `quality/results/run-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.json` recording model, provider, runner, timestamps, phase timings, bug counts, and gate results. Enables comparison across models and runs.
- **Sonnet recommended as default model.** Sonnet 4.6 found 25 bugs (3 HIGH) at ~3% weekly usage vs Opus's 19 bugs (1 HIGH) at ~8%. More bugs, more HIGH severity, lower cost.

### What's new in v1.4.1

- **Recheck mode.** After fixing bugs, say "recheck" to verify fixes without re-running the full pipeline. Reads the existing BUGS.md, checks each bug against the current source (reverse-applying patches, inspecting cited lines), and outputs machine-readable results to `quality/results/recheck-results.json`. Takes 2-10 minutes instead of 60-90.
- **19 bug fixes from bootstrap self-audit.** Fixed eval injection in quality_gate.sh, bash 3.2 empty array crashes, required artifacts downgraded to WARN, json_key_count false positives, missing artifact checks, and documentation inconsistencies. All verified by recheck (19/19 FIXED).

### What's new in v1.4.0

- **Six-phase architecture with clean context windows.** The playbook now runs as six distinct phases (Explore, Generate, Review, Audit, Reconcile, Verify), each designed to execute in a separate session with its own context window. Phase prompts include exit gates that verify prerequisites before starting and artifact completeness before finishing. This eliminates context-window exhaustion on large codebases and makes each phase independently re-runnable.
- **Phase-by-phase runner with `--phase` flag.** The standard-library Python runner at `bin/run_playbook.py` supports `--phase all` (run phases 1-6 sequentially with gates between each), `--phase 3` (run a single phase), or `--phase 3,4,5` (run a range). Each invocation gets a fresh CLI session, communicating through files on disk.
- **Four iteration strategies.** After the baseline run, the playbook supports four iteration strategies that find different classes of bugs: gap (explore areas the baseline missed), unfiltered (fresh-eyes re-review), parity (parallel path comparison), and adversarial (challenge prior dismissals and recover Type II errors). Iterations consistently add 40-60% more confirmed bugs on top of the baseline.
- **TDD red-green verification for every confirmed bug.** Every bug in BUGS.md must have a regression test patch, a red-phase log proving the test detects the bug on unpatched code, and a green-phase log proving the fix resolves it. The `tdd-results.json` sidecar (schema 1.1) tracks all verdicts with machine-readable fields.
- **Quality gate script.** A mechanical validation script (originally `quality_gate.sh`, now `quality_gate.py`) validates artifact completeness: patch files, writeups, TDD logs, JSON schema conformance, version stamps, and BUGS.md heading format. Runs as the final Phase 6 step.
- **Benchmark results across three codebases.** Validated against Express.js (14 confirmed bugs), Gson (9 confirmed bugs), and Linux virtio (8 confirmed bugs), all with 100% TDD red-phase coverage and 0 gate failures.

### What's new in v1.3.20

- **Mechanical verification artifacts with integrity check (council-recommended).** Before CONTRACTS.md can assert that a dispatch function handles specific constants, you must generate and execute a shell pipeline (awk/grep) that extracts actual case labels from the function body, saving to `quality/mechanical/<function>_cases.txt`. Each extraction command is also appended to `quality/mechanical/verify.sh`, which re-runs the same commands and diffs against saved files. Phase 6 must execute `verify.sh` — if any diff is non-empty, the artifact was tampered with. This integrity check was added because v1.3.19 testing showed the model can execute the correct command but write fabricated output to the file instead of letting the shell redirect capture it.
- **Source-inspection tests must execute (no `run=False`).** Regression tests that verify source structure (string presence, case label existence) are safe, deterministic, and must run. The `run=False` flag is banned for these tests. In v1.3.18, the correct assertion existed but never fired because `run=False` made it inert.
- **Contradiction gate.** Before closure, executed evidence (mechanical artifacts, regression test results, TDD red-phase failures) is compared against prose artifacts (requirements, contracts, triage, BUGS.md). If they contradict, the executed result wins — the prose artifact must be corrected before proceeding.
- **Effective council gating for enumeration checks.** If the council is incomplete (<3/3) and the run includes whitelist/dispatch checks, the audit cannot close those checks without mechanical proof artifacts.
- **Normative vs. descriptive contract language.** Requirements use "must preserve" (normative) unless a mechanical artifact confirms the claim, in which case "preserves" (descriptive) is allowed.
- **Self-contained iterative convergence.** New Phase 0 (Prior Run Analysis) builds a seed list from prior runs' confirmed bugs and mechanically re-checks each seed against the current source tree. After Phase 6, a convergence check compares net-new bugs against the seed list. When net-new bugs = 0, bug discovery has converged. When not converged, the skill automatically archives the current run to `quality/runs/` and re-iterates from Phase 0 — up to 5 iterations by default (configurable). No external scripts needed; the skill handles the full iteration loop internally with context-window awareness. A `run_iterate.sh` script is also available for shell-level orchestration.
- **45 self-check benchmarks** (up from 22).

## Validation

The playbook is validated against the [Quality Playbook Benchmark](https://github.com/andrewstellman/quality-playbook-benchmark): 2,564 real defects from 50 open-source repositories across 14 programming languages. Instead of injecting synthetic faults, we use real historical bugs tied to single fix commits as ground truth.

The key finding: approximately 65% of real defects are detectable by structural code review alone. The remaining 35% are intent violations that require knowing what the code is supposed to do. The playbook's value is in closing that gap.

## Setting up automation scripts

The repository includes a standard-library Python runner at `bin/run_playbook.py`.

Positional arguments are **directory paths** (relative or absolute). Omit positional args to run against the current directory. One convenience applies only to **bare names** (no path separators, no leading `.` / `..` / `~`): if `chi` isn't a directory, the runner retries `chi-<version>` using the `version:` line from `SKILL.md` at the QPB root. Path-like inputs (`./chi`, `/abs/chi`) are taken literally — no fallback.

```bash
cd my-project
python3 /path/to/quality-playbook/bin/run_playbook.py                      # run on cwd
python3 /path/to/quality-playbook/bin/run_playbook.py --phase all          # phase-by-phase on cwd
python3 /path/to/quality-playbook/bin/run_playbook.py ./project1 ./project2  # multiple targets
python3 /path/to/quality-playbook/bin/run_playbook.py --claude --model opus --phase all ./project1
python3 /path/to/quality-playbook/bin/run_playbook.py --next-iteration --strategy gap ./project1
```

For benchmark use, run from the `repos/` folder so relative paths resolve to the versioned working copies produced by `setup_repos.sh`:

```bash
cd repos
python3 ../bin/run_playbook.py --phase all --sequential chi-1.4.6
python3 ../bin/run_playbook.py chi     # resolves to chi-1.4.6 via SKILL.md version
```

**Rate limit warning:** Running multiple targets in parallel with single-prompt mode (no `--phase`) sends long autonomous prompts that consume large amounts of API quota. In testing, running 8 targets in parallel single-prompt mode triggered a 54-hour Copilot rate limit. Use `--phase all` instead — it runs each phase as a separate, shorter prompt with exit gates between phases. This uses less quota per prompt, produces better results (each phase gets a full context window), and is easier to resume if interrupted. For the same reason, prefer `--sequential` over `--parallel` unless you're confident in your rate limit headroom.

### Usage

```text
usage: run_playbook.py [-h] [--parallel | --sequential] [--claude | --copilot]
                       [--no-seeds | --with-seeds] [--phase PHASE]
                       [--next-iteration]
                       [--strategy {gap,unfiltered,parity,adversarial,all}]
                       [--model MODEL] [--kill]
                       [targets ...]

Run the Quality Playbook against one or more target directories.

positional arguments:
  targets               Target directories to run against (relative or absolute
                        paths). Defaults to the current directory.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --parallel            Run all targets concurrently (default).
  --sequential          Run targets one after another.
  --claude              Use claude -p instead of gh copilot.
  --copilot             Use gh copilot (default).
  --no-seeds            Skip Phase 0/0b seed injection (default).
  --with-seeds          Allow Phase 0/0b seed injection from prior or sibling runs.
  --phase PHASE         Run specific phase(s): 1-6, all, or comma-separated values like 3,4,5.
  --next-iteration      Iterate on an existing quality/ run.
  --strategy {gap,unfiltered,parity,adversarial,all}
                        Iteration strategy to use with --next-iteration.
  --model MODEL         Runner model override (copilot: gpt-5.4, claude: sonnet/opus/etc).
  --kill                Kill processes from the current or last parallel run.
