#!/bin/bash
# Set up benchmark repos for the current SKILL.md version.
#
# Default: copies from clean/ (pristine shallow clones) and docs_gathered/<repo>/
# (curated specification documents). This ensures zero contamination from prior runs.
#
# Fallback: if clean/<repo> doesn't exist, falls back to copying from the most
# recent prior version (the old behavior), with a loud warning.
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup_repos.sh              # All known repos
#   ./setup_repos.sh chi httpx    # Specific repos
#   ./setup_repos.sh --from-prior chi httpx   # Force old copy-from-latest behavior
#
#   # Override destination (e.g., to set up a single repo into a harness run dir):
#   ./setup_repos.sh --target-folder runs/cross_v1.4.5/casbin/replicate-1/ --replace casbin
#
# Flags:
#   --from-prior          Force copy-from-latest-prior-version fallback path
#   --target-folder PATH  Override destination from default repos/<repo>-<version>/.
#                         Requires exactly one positional repo argument. If PATH
#                         already exists, --replace must also be given.
#   --replace             Destructive: rm -rf an existing destination instead of
#                         backing it up. Required with --target-folder when the
#                         target path already exists. Without --target-folder
#                         (the common case), the default is now backup-by-default:
#                         existing repos/<repo>-<version>/ is renamed to
#                         repos/<repo>-<version>.bak-<UTC-ts>/ before the fresh
#                         install lands (v1.5.7 fix F-3, preserves prior repo
#                         state including D1 gate-failure dirs).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   ./create_clean_repos.sh       # Populate clean/ (one-time)
#
# Version-pinned source override:
#   QPB_SKILL_DIR=/path/to/version-pinned-qpb ./setup_repos.sh ...
#       (recognized by _benchmark_lib.sh; defaults to the parent of repos/)
#
# After setup, run from the QPB clone root (defaults: Copilot,

#   python3 -m bin.run_playbook repos/chi-1.5.7          # canonical package form
